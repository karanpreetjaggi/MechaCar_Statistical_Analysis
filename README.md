## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Multiple regression was performed on MechaCar data. Looking at the analysis, it is clear that vehicle weight, spoiler angle and AWD have less chance of affecting MPG since their P-value's are higher.Since vehicle length and ground clearance have lower p-values, thus these variables might have more impact on MPG.
Also, r-squared value of multiple linear regression is 0.714 which means that approx 71% of all MPG predictions can be correct when using linear model. Our p-value is much smaller than significance level 0.05 which means that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and therefore the overall slope of linear model is not zero.
